### About Me

Meet Vijay.
Engineer by trade, explorer by instinct, and a collector of experiences in between.

He’s built backend systems, data pipelines, and architectures sturdy enough to keep trucks rolling across America (literally, at Motive Inc.), and has left his fingerprints on Razorpay and Treebo along the way. But don’t let the code fool you. Vijay isn’t the kind of guy who lives only inside a terminal window.

Give him a remote job and he’s probably halfway across a new city every month, camera slung over his shoulder, hunting for stories worth capturing (or the crispiest samosa in town). Hand him a bag of beans, and he’ll brew a cup of coffee that could make a barista rethink their career. Catch him at night, and you might find him sipping a scotch, plotting his next adventure, or practicing Spanish just so he can haggle for churros in Madrid someday.

Vijay is equal parts pragmatist and dreamer:

* He’s got a system for everything (shoutout to PARA).
* He’s chasing financial freedom while also chasing sunsets.
* He wants to build scalable infrastructure and send postcards to his besties to remind them the world is worth exploring.

Languages? Too many to list without bragging (English, Hindi, Telugu, Odiya, bits of Marathi, Kannada, and now Spanish). Passions? Photography, psychology, travel, productivity hacks, and pretty much anything that makes life feel richer, sharper, or more fun.

In his own words:
“Life is all about experiences; and I’m here to focus on the intensity of them.”
